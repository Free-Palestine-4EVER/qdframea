## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QDFRAMES.NL

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Immediate Impact on Conversions)

#### 1. Add a Simple Window/Door Configurator
**Why:** Internorm's door designer and REHAU Connect show this is an industry expectation. A configurator keeps visitors engaged 3-5x longer and captures leads through "save my design" / "get quote for this config."  
**Action:** Build a step-by-step configurator: select product type → profile (76/82/88mm) → dimensions → color → glazing → hardware → instant ballpark price + "Request Exact Quote" CTA.  
**Effort:** Medium-high | **Impact:** Very high

#### 2. Build a Project Gallery (Minimum 20 Projects)
**Why:** Aluprof's 300+ project gallery and VELUX's case studies are their strongest trust tools. Visual proof converts.  
**Action:** Photograph completed installations. For each: country flag, product used, number of units, before/after if possible, one client quote. Organize by country and project type.  
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High

#### 3. Scale Testimonials to 15-20+ with Rich Details
**Why:** QD Frames has 3 testimonials — far more than competitors (who show zero), but not enough to build serious trust for high-value purchases (€5,000–€20,000+).  
**Action:** Collect reviews with: full name, city + country, project scope (e.g., "12 windows + 2 doors"), photo of installed products, star rating. Add Google Reviews widget or Trustpilot integration.  
**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** High

#### 4. Add Multi-Language Support (NL, DE, FR minimum)
**Why:** Serving 28 countries in English only loses massive conversion potential. Oknoplast has 12+ localized sites. Even basic NL/DE/FR covers your core markets.  
**Action:** Translate site into Dutch (home market), German (biggest EU window market), and French. Add language selector to header.  
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Build Trust & Authority)

#### 5. Create a Detailed Certifications Page
**Why:** Aluprof displays 8+ named certifications with institute names. QD Frames mentions "CE & ISO" in passing — this undersells.  
**Action:** Create a dedicated trust/quality page showing: Salamander profile certifications, CE marking details, ISO number, test results (U-values, sound reduction, wind resistance), any Passive House or energy ratings. Use logos and certificate images.  
**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** Medium-high

#### 6. Add a Sustainability Section
**Why:** Schüco, VELUX, Deceuninck, and Oknoplast all lead with sustainability. European consumers increasingly factor this into purchasing decisions.  
**Action:** Highlight: Salamander's recyclability, profile longevity (40+ years), energy savings from better insulation, reduced carbon from factory-direct shipping vs. local supply chains. Add an "Environmental Impact" section to homepage.  
**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** Medium

#### 7. Name and Brand Your Product Lines
**Why:** Oknoplast's PILAR, PIXEL, PAVA feel premium and memorable. "76mm Salamander profile" is technical and forgettable.  
**Action:** Create branded collections: e.g., "QD Essential" (76mm), "QD Performance" (82mm), "QD Elite" (88mm). Give each a personality page with lifestyle photography.  
**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** Medium

#### 8. Add Design Style Segmentation
**Why:** Internorm's 4 architectural styles (Studio, Home Pure, Home Soft, Ambiente) help visitors find products that match their taste instantly.  
**Action:** Create 3-4 design style pages: Modern/Minimal, Classic/Traditional, Industrial/Loft, Mediterranean. Show product recommendations for each with lifestyle images.  
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium

### 🟢 LOWER PRIORITY (Long-term Authority Building)

#### 9. Launch a Knowledge Hub / Blog
**Why:** VELUX's research content and case studies establish thought leadership. Zero competitors in this list have strong consumer education content — massive opportunity to rank in SEO.  
**Action:** Publish: "How to Choose Windows for [Country]" guides, "U-Value Explained," "UPVC vs Aluminium," renovation stories, energy savings calculators. Target 2-4 articles/month.  
**Effort:** Ongoing | **Impact:** Medium (compounds over time)

#### 10. Add a Savings Calculator
**Why:** No competitor offers this. QD Frames' "30–40% savings" claim would be 10x more powerful as an interactive tool.  
**Action:** Build a simple calculator: "Enter your local quote amount → See QD Frames estimated price." Or: "Select window count + size → See estimated savings vs. market average."  
**Effort:** Low-medium | **Impact:** Medium-high

#### 11. Add Video Content
**Why:** No competitor does this well. Factory tours, installation timelapses, customer testimonial videos would differentiate massively.  
**Action:** Produce 3-5 videos: factory tour, profile quality demonstration, packaging/shipping process, customer installation story. Embed on homepage and product pages.  
**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium

#### 12. Implement Live Chat (Beyond WhatsApp)
**Why:** WhatsApp is great for mobile but some European B2B/professional buyers prefer website chat. Schüco offers full lifecycle support; QD Frames should match accessibility.  
**Action:** Add Tawk.to or Crisp chat widget alongside WhatsApp. Set up auto-responder for off-hours with "We reply within 24h" promise.  
**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** Low-medium
